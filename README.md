# Dissecting-Yelp-Dataset
*A trove of reviews, businesses, users, tips, and check-in data!*

This dataset is a subset of Yelp's businesses, reviews, and user data. It was originally put together for the Yelp Dataset Challenge which is a chance for students to conduct research or analysis on Yelp's data and share their discoveries. In the dataset you'll find information about businesses across 11 metropolitan areas in four countries.


## Part 1: Installation and Initial Setup
```
In this portion, we will import the necessary dependencies (pandas and matplotlib) and load your dataset as a pyspark dataframe.
```
* ```Loading data into S3 bucket```

## Part 2: Analyzing Categories
```
For this part, we will take a stab at denormalizing the categories that are associated with each business (there may be more than one, presented as a string of comma separated identifiers) and then running some basic analysis on the result.
```

## Part 3: Do Yelp Reviews Skew Negative?
```
For this next part, you will attempt to answer the question: are the (written) reviews generally more pessimistic or more optimistic as compared to the overall business rating.
```

- [ ] This module is under progress


## Part 4: Should the Elite be Trusted?
```
For this final part we may choose to either answer this question posed or explore the data in some other manner of own own choosing. The only requirements are:
●	You must leverage the users dataset provided
●	You must have at least one data visualization as part of your analysis
```

- [ ] This module is not starterd yet
