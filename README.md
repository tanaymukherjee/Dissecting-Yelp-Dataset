# Dissecting-Yelp-Dataset
This dataset is a subset of Yelp's businesses, reviews, and user data. It was originally put together for the Yelp Dataset Challenge which is a chance for students to conduct research or analysis on Yelp's data and share their discoveries. In the dataset you'll find information about businesses across 11 metropolitan areas in four countries.
