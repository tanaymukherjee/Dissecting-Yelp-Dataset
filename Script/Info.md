# Automating data directly into S3 using Kaggle APIs

## Additional Exercise
*This is an extra credit exercise for this project.*

### Objective:
To write a python or bash script that leverages the kaggle API module to download the dataset and the AWS boto3 module to upload to S3. This script must run in a docker container and it should work for anyoneâ€™s AWS and Kaggle accounts for any dataset. (For example, if I wanted to download kaggle dataset ABC and then upload it to my S3 bucket DEF - I should be able to manage this. This script must not be specific to the datasets or accounts for this project).
