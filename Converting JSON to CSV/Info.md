# Converting JSON to CSV

This part is not part of the original exercise as wirth AWS S3 we can easily load gigabytes of data in no time and use it for our analysis while distritbuting the task through multiple nodes and optimising the process using spark.

However, as part of analysis I converted JSON to CSV and it was a great learning experience. Though, the main analysis will be done using JSON only on EC2.
